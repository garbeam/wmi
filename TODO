See wmi-devel mailinglist at http://wmi.berlios.de for details.

19:37 < zahod_> Garbeam, hmm, looks like you use
color.frame.shadow/shine.normal for unfocused 
clients in larsmode, which are set to black by default,
thus you can't see the borders if you use black background in
your terminals.  19:40 < zahod_> and if you change it to
color.frame.background.normal, then you will have the same 
problems with white terminals, probably two of the most common
colors 19:41 < zahod_> so I think an theme.conf option would be good


TODOs for wmii-1:

+ mod1+button3 resize similar to grab-move function
? history for input mode (remembers last actions)
+ resize increments handling
+ client request colormap support
+ window-snap-to-border for everything(!)
+ Drag'n'drop client detach/attaching like Ion does

FUTURE refactoring:

- Implement more self-destroying methods (themes deallocation, etc.)
