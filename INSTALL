3. Installation of a released version:

# ./configure
# make
# sudo make install


4. Some build notes about configure arguments

4.1. Notes for Xft support

If you've installed Xft and freetype WMI will build with
Xft support by default. If Xft is not installed WMI won't
build with Xft support. If you explicitly don't want Xft
support, although having Xft installed just use following
configure argument:

./configure --without-xft

4.2. Notes for stacked tabbing

WMI supports stacked tabbing with stack-alike visual
feedback within frame bars, groups and pagers. This feature
is not seen in any other window manager but disabled by
default. It's highly recommended to give it a try. All
focussed clients, groups, workspaces are arranged in
stacking order from left to right, the topmost element
is arranged leftwards and the bottom element is arranged
rightwards.
This results that the focussed element (e.g. a client in
a frame bar or group bar) appears always left, thus the
focus never changes, but the titles and order.
Just use following configure argument:

./configure --with-stacked-tabbing

4.3. Notes for debug support

To run WMI with verbose debug output you've to configure it
with debug support:

./configure --with-debug

4.4. Notes for diamond box

By default WMI draws a diamond box while resizing/moving
clients. If you don't like drawing the diamond box you
can disable it using:

./configure --without-diamond

4.5. Notes for disabling the slot

By default WMI is built with slot support.
If you don't need it you can disable it using:

./configure --without-slot


5. Start WMI

To start WMI as your default window manager add following line
to your $HOME/.xinitrc:

exec wmi

and type

# startx

afterwards to launch X and the WMI.
